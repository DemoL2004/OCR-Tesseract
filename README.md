# OCR-Tesseract
A Project to Test and Integrate Tesseract in a pipeline to increase its capability and build a more powerful OCR 

# Steps to be followed:


# Step 1: Analyze Tesseract capability and integrate it into Orca pipeline :

This step  involves evaluating the performance of Tesseract OCR on a variety of image inputs and determining its strengths and weaknesses. Some configuration      changes may be experimented with  (such as language models or page segmentation modes) to optimize its performance for the use case.
Integrating Tesseract into the Orca pipeline may involve writing Python code that uses the Pytesseract library to process images and extract text. Depending on the requirements of the project


# Step 2: Identify independent models of OCR and integrate them into Orca pipeline :

This step involves identifying other OCR models or frameworks that may complement Tesseract or provide additional capabilities. For example,  models like EasyOCR or Kraken that use deep learning to improve OCR accuracy or handle complex layouts.
Integrating multiple OCR models into the Orca pipeline may involve designing a modular architecture that can handle multiple types of input or dynamically switch between OCR models depending on the characteristics of the input image.


# Step 3: Verify with browsers :

This step may involve testing the performance of the OCR pipeline on a variety of web-based inputs, such as screenshots of web pages or images embedded in web content. You may need to write scripts or use existing tools to automate the testing process and evaluate the accuracy and speed of the OCR engine in a real-world setting.
